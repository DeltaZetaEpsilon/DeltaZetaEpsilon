As soon as I wake up, I immediately check my surroundings. I'm still trapped in my cell. In a way, it's a good thing. As weird as that sounds. It means the scientists didn't move me in my sleep. It's never a good thing when that happens. But it's even worse when I wake up alone and realise they've taken my brother. It makes me crazy with anger and fear. Anger that he's likely being hurt and I'm not there to protect him, and fear of not knowing when - or if - he'll return.

Thankfully, they didn't take him last night. He's still asleep beside me. I could feel his shoulder against mine as soon as I woke up. [nest]

, and I spend a few minutes watching him sleep. This is one of the only peaceful moments I'll have all day, and I do my best to savour it. It's quiet, except for the sound of my brother's deep breaths. It's soothing.

His breathing is deep and soothing.

Zeta lets out a snort and I turn to look at him. His shoulder-length brown hair covers half his face. There's a trail of drool leading from the corner of his mouth to the pillow beneath him. I smile.

This is one of the only peaceful moments I'll have all day, and I do my best to savour it. The only sound is Zeta's deep breathing
